# Invariant-Measures-in-Time-Delay-Coordinates-for-Unique-Dynamical-System-Identification

This repository contains Python code for reproducing the results in our work *[Invariant Measures in Time-Delay Coordinates for Unique Dynamical System Idenfitification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00589v1).* 

- `Torus Rotation`: This folder contains code for visualizing the state-coordinate and delay-coordinate invariant measures of a torus rotation.

     - `torus_rotation.py`: Simulates long trajectories of the torus rotation for four different rotation numbers and plots the trajectory samples in both the 3D projected state-coordinates and a 3D delay coordinate syste.

 - `Lorenz Example`: This folder contains our numerical experiments for learning the dynamics of the Lorenz-63 equations using delay-coordinate invariant measures
